--- Installing MicroMVC ---

Copy "sample.config.php" to "config.php".

To get the MicroMVC framework up and running you must setup the server vhost using Apache, Lighttpd, or Nginx.

If you are using the Apache web server you must rename "sample.htaccess" to ".htaccess" and edit the file to match your requirements. The most important thing to set is the "RewriteBase" base path on line 37. If micromvc is installed at http://micromvc.com then the base path can be left as-is ("RewriteBase /"). However, if you were installing in http://micromvc.com/framework/ then line 37 would read "RewriteBase /framework".

If you are using Nginx then you must already know what you're doing and you can use the sample.nginx.conf as a starting point for getting MicroMVC running.

Sorry, but Lighttpd users will have to figure the rest out on their own until someone writes a sample vhost config.

After that, you must rename sample.config.php to config.php and edit it to suit your requirements. This is the core configuration file for the micromvc system and stored global info like your database connection data.

Note: If you are using git to manage all files in your directory it is recommended that you keep the .htaccess and config.php files OUT of the repository since they will change for each new deploy environment (dev, staging, production, etc...).
